## nft preview card component main

 nft preview card challenge. Fron-end Mentor's second challenge.
 
 I decided not to put the image in HTML because it would be necessary to use a color in the tone next to the aqua color. So I created a div of "id" "img" and put the photo as background-image.

So I created a div:hov next to div:img, adjusted the "position", "z-index" to perform the hover requirido in the project.
